05/21/2022 and 05/22/2022 (Zoom Meetings)
Brainstormed multiple ideas in how to implement the threads. Determined that we need to do a bit more learning in how threads work before starting coding.

05/29/2022 (Zoom Meeting)
Team made separate branches to practice thread implementations. Split the workflow into two sections - a mapper workflow and a reducer workflow so that they are able to be called separately by individual threads. Had difficulty with the correct syntax for threads.

05/30/2022 (Zoom Meeting)
Still had difficulty with the correct syntax for threads. Not much progress.

05/31/2022 (Individual Work)
Huiying had a breaktrhough and succesfully implemented mapper threads. Both members reviewed code.

06/01/2022 (Individual Work)
Huiying implemented reducer threads. Omar added workflow partition method. Both members reviewed code.
