Omar and Huiying followed the professor's instruction sheet for setting up DLLs. Created two DLLs (Mapper_DLL and Reducer_DLL) and set up the configuration references. Spent some time removing the FileManager association from the original Mapper implementation so that DLLs can be independently called. Build issues at the end of the day related to using namespace std.

Omar and Huiying continued implementing the DLLs. Resolved the using namespace std by importing individual std libraries as needed. Faced multiple variable incompatible issues with the extern "C" declarations. Built the solution succesfully but the DLLs are still not returning the desired output.

Determined that the best way to overcome the extern "C" issue was to make the DLL functions return void and just engage the file operations directly from the DLL. Huiying added Boost functionality to be able to use a tokenizer function to remove special characters in the Mapper DLL.

Met with the professor in office hour to answer questions. Based on the professor's recommendation, decided to keep all DLLs in the same folder as the executable and not ask the user for a path to the DLLs. Tested the code in both Omar and Huiying's PCs and the files were Mapped and Reduced succesfully with the DLLs. Updated the Readme file to reflect the Mapper and Reducer changing from classes to DLLs.
